# Agent Protocol Specification

## Migration Notice
The topics formerly discussed here were **out of date**; all agent protocol and standardization discussions have moved
to the Hyperledger Aries Project. Refer to the [Aries RFCs][1] Repository for protocol specs and to the [Hyperledger
Aries Rocket.Chat Channel][2] for questions.

Refer to [the main README][3] for a list of projects that supersede those contained in the Indy Agent repository.
